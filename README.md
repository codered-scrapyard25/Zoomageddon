# Zoomageddon ðŸ”¥

A chaotic desktop prank application that records audio, takes screenshots, plays random sounds, and opens random websites while you're browsing.

## Description

Zoomageddon is a multi-threaded Python application designed to create a hilariously disruptive computing experience. It runs three parallel processes:

1. **Audio Recording & Response Generation**: Records your audio, takes screenshots, analyzes what it sees and hears, and then generates sarcastic voice responses.
2. **Random Sound Player**: Plays random weird sound effects at unpredictable intervals.
3. **Random Website Opener**: Opens bizarre websites randomly when a browser window is detected.

This project was made @ **Scrapyard Hyderabad 2025** by **Team CodeRed**

## Features

- Voice recording and transcription using AssemblyAI
- Screenshot capture and image analysis with LLaMA 3.2 Vision
- Text-to-speech response generation
- Random sound playback from a local directory
- Browser detection and random website opening
- Multi-threaded operation to maximize chaos

## Requirements

### Python Libraries
- time
- base64
- pyttsx3
- pyautogui
- pyaudio
- wave
- assemblyai
- groq
- os
- random
- pygame
- webbrowser
- threading
- platform
- pygetwindow

### API Keys
- AssemblyAI API key
- Groq API key

### Additional Requirements
- A folder named "Weird Sounds" containing .mp3 or .wav sound files
- Internet connection for API calls
- A microphone and speakers

## Quick Start: Pre-configured Version

If you don't want to set up your own music, API keys, or configure the application yourself, you can use our pre-configured version:

### Pre-configured Package

1. Download the pre-configured package from example execution folder.

2. Install all requirements.
   ```
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. Run the zoomageddon example execution file:
   ```
   python zoomageddon_exec.py
   ```

The pre-configured version includes:
- 10+ weird sound effects
- Working API keys (with usage limits)
- Default configuration settings
- 10+ prank websites to redirect to

### Usage Notes for Pre-configured Version

- The included API keys have limited usage. For extended use, please replace with your own keys.
- The pre-configured package works out of the box, but has fewer customization options than the source code version.
- Updates to the pre-configured version may lag behind the main repository.

To switch to the full version later, follow the standard installation instructions in the section above.

## Installation

### 

1. Clone the repository.

2. Install required packages:
   ```
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. Create a "Weird Sounds" folder and add some .mp3 or .wav files to it.

4. Set up your API keys:
   - Register for AssemblyAI at https://www.assemblyai.com/
   - Register for Groq at https://console.groq.com/
   - Update the API keys in the code:

      ```python
     aai.settings.api_key = "YOUR_ASSEMBLYAI_API_KEY"
     client = Groq(api_key='YOUR_GROQ_API_KEY')
     ```

## Usage

Run the program with Python:
```
python zoomageddon.py
```

To stop the program, press `Ctrl+C` in the terminal.

## How It Works

### Process 1: Audio Recording & Response Generation
- Records 5 seconds of audio and saves it as "output.wav"
- Takes a screenshot and saves it as "screenshot.png"
- Transcribes the audio using AssemblyAI
- Analyzes the screenshot using LLaMA 3.2 Vision model
- Generates a sarcastic response based on the transcription and image analysis
- Converts the response to speech

### Process 2: Random Sound Player
- Loads sound files from the "Weird Sounds" directory
- Waits a random period (5-15 seconds)
- Plays a random sound file

### Process 3: Random Website Opener
- Checks if a browser window is currently in focus
- If a browser is detected, opens a random website from the predefined list
- Waits 10 seconds before potentially opening another website

## Customization

### Adding New Sounds
Add .mp3 or .wav files to the "Weird Sounds" directory.

### Modifying Website List
Edit the `websites` list in the code to add or remove websites.

### Adjusting Timing
- Change the recording duration by modifying the `record_seconds` parameter in the `record_audio` function call
- Adjust the website opening frequency by changing the sleep time in `process_3`
- Modify the sound playing frequency by changing the random range in `process_2`
